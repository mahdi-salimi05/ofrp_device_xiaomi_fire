## How to build

1. Set up the build environment following the instructions [here](https://wiki.orangefox.tech/en/dev/building#h-0-prepare-the-build-environment-debian-based-linux-distros)

2. In the root folder of the fetched [repo](https://wiki.orangefox.tech/en/dev/building#h-1-sync-orangefox-sources-and-minimal-manifest), clone the device tree:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahdi-salimi05/ofrp_device_xiaomi_fire.git device/xiaomi/fire
```

3. To build:

```bash
cd ~/OrangeFox # (or whichever directory has the synced manifest)
  /bin/bash # if your Linux shell isn't bash
  export ALLOW_MISSING_DEPENDENCIES=true
  export FOX_BUILD_DEVICE=<device>
  export LC_ALL="C"

# for all brances
  source build/envsetup.sh

# for branches lower than 11.0
  lunch omni_<device>-eng && mka recoveryimage

# for branches lower than 11.0, with A/B partitioning
  lunch omni_<device>-eng && mka bootimage

# for the 11.0 (or higher) branch
  lunch twrp_<device>-eng && mka adbd recoveryimage

# for the 11.0 (or higher) branch, with A/B partitioning
  lunch twrp_<device>-eng && mka adbd bootimage

# for the 12.1 (or higher) branch, vendor_boot-as-recovery builds [this is highly experimental and unsupported!]
  lunch twrp_<device>-eng && mka adbd vendorbootimage
```

## How to install "permanently"

1. download orangefox image [here](https://github.com/mahdi-salimi05/OrangeFox-Action-Builder/releases) [(old version is here)](https://github.com/mahdi-salimi05/Action-OFRP-Builder/releases).

2. dump your boot image with [mtkclient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient):

```bash
python3 mtk r boot boot.img
```

3. flash [orangefox image](https://github.com/mahdi-salimi05/Action-OFRP-Builder/releases) to your boot_a "or boot" partition

```bash
fastboot flash boot OrangeFox-R12.1-Unofficial-fire.img
```

4. reboot to recovery

```bash
fastboot reboot recovery
```

5. Once booted, put your stock boot image in Internalstorage , MicroSdcard or Usb-Otg then Flash stock boot image in boot partition and tick (Flash to both slots) (this will remove OF recovery form your device; you need to reflash orange fox from menu>Flash current OF).
after that it is better to flash OF.zip file
