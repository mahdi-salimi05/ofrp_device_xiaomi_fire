## How to install

download orangefox image [here](https://github.com/mahdi-salimi05/Action-OFRP-Builder/releases).

first dump your boot image with mtkclient and flash orangefox image to your boot partition; and then boot to recovery and flash your dumped boot image on both slots (this will remove OF recovery form your device; you need to reflash orange fox from menu>Flash current OF).
after that it is better to flash OF.zip file
